# Fan Beam CT reconstruction (Tensorflow Op) :sparkles:

## TensorFlow Op for CT Reconstruction :mag:

This repository houses the filter backprojection codes, which have been crafted in CUDA/C. The codes are then seamlessly wrapped within the TensorFlow Op framework (works for TF<2).

### :pushpin: Purpose & Context

The implementation primarily serves as the **forward projection module** in the research paper:
