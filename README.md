## TensorFlow Op for CT Reconstruction :mag:

This repository houses the filter backprojection codes, which have been crafted in CUDA/C. The codes are then seamlessly wrapped within the TensorFlow Op framework (works for TF<2).

### :pushpin: Purpose & Context

The implementation primarily serves as the **forward projection module** in the research paper:

> [**A quality‐checked and physics‐constrained deep learning method to estimate material basis images from single‐kV contrast‐enhanced chest CT scans**](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mp.16352) published in *Medical Physics*.


### :wrench: Technical Highlights

- **Languages & Technologies Used**: CUDA/C 
- **Integration**: TensorFlow Op
